In a post-war country, the battle may be over, but the dangers still lurk in the form of unexploded ordnance (UXO), toxic waste, and biological hazards. Entire communities live under constant threat—children unknowingly wandering into gore sites, families exposed to hazardous waste, and entire areas rendered unsafe due to contamination.

This project introduces an AI-powered waste classification system designed to identify, analyze, and quarantine dangerous zones before harm is done. Our AI model helps:
1) Classify waste in real time—determining if it's toxic, explosive, or biological.
2) Quarantine hazardous areas—ensuring civilians, especially children, stay away.
3) Protect communities from exposure to dangerous remnants of war.

The Future Vision
This is just the beginning. Imagine deploying autonomous robots into these recovery zones, similar to Tesla’s Full Self-Driving (FSD) system but trained for post-war safety. These robots would scan the environment, classify waste in real time, and create safety maps before humans step in.

With AI and robotics, we can turn war-torn regions into safe, livable spaces again. The scars of war shouldn't define the future—technology can help rebuild, protect, and restore hope.

Let’s make the world safer, one classification at a time.
